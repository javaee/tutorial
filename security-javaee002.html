<h2 id="securing-enterprise-beans">Securing Enterprise Beans</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enterprise beans are Java EE components that implement EJB technology.
Enterprise beans run in the EJB container, a runtime environment within
GlassFish Server. Although transparent to the application developer, the
EJB container provides system-level services, such as transactions and
security to its enterprise beans, which form the core of transactional
Java EE applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enterprise bean methods can be secured in either of the following ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Declarative security (preferred): Expresses an application component&#8217;s
security requirements using either deployment descriptors or
annotations. The presence of an annotation in the business method of an
enterprise bean class that specifies method permissions is all that is
needed for method protection and authentication in some situations. This
section discusses this simple and efficient method of securing
enterprise beans.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of some limitations to the simplified method of securing
enterprise beans, you would want to continue to use the deployment
descriptor to specify security information in some instances. An
authentication mechanism must be configured on the server for the simple
solution to work. Basic authentication is GlassFish Server&#8217;s default
authentication method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tutorial explains how to invoke user name/password authentication
of authorized users by decorating the enterprise application&#8217;s business
methods with annotations that specify method permissions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make the deployer&#8217;s task easier, the application developer can define
security roles. A security role is a grouping of permissions that a
given type of application users must have in order to successfully use
the application. For example, in a payroll application, some users will
want to view their own payroll information (employee), some will need to
view others' payroll information (manager), and some will need to be
able to change others' payroll information (payrollDept). The
application developer would determine the potential users of the
application and which methods would be accessible to which users. The
application developer would then decorate classes or methods of the
enterprise bean with annotations that specify the types of users
authorized to access those methods. Using annotations to specify
authorized users is described in <a href="#GJGCQ">Specifying Authorized Users
by Declaring Security Roles</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When one of the annotations is used to define method permissions, the
deployment system will automatically require user name/password
authentication. In this type of authentication, a user is prompted to
enter a user name and password, which will be compared against a
database of known users. If the user is found and the password matches,
the roles that the user is assigned will be compared against the roles
that are authorized to access the method. If the user is authenticated
and found to have a role that is authorized to access that method, the
data will be returned to the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using declarative security is discussed in <a href="#GJGDI">Securing an
Enterprise Bean Using Declarative Security</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programmatic security: For an enterprise bean, code embedded in a
business method that is used to access a caller&#8217;s identity
programmatically and that uses this information to make security
decisions. Programmatic security is useful when declarative security
alone is not sufficient to express the security model of an application.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, security management should be enforced by the container in a
manner that is transparent to the enterprise beans' business methods.
The programmatic security APIs described in this chapter should be used
only in the less frequent situations in which the enterprise bean
business methods need to access the security-context information, such
as when you want to grant access based on the time of day or other
nontrivial condition checks for a particular role.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programmatic security is discussed in <a href="#GJGCS">Securing an Enterprise
Bean Programmatically</a>.</p>

Enterprise Beans"</a>, and <a href="security-intro.html#BNBWJ">Chapter 50,
"Introduction to Security in the Java EE Platform"</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section discusses securing a Java EE application where one or more
modules, such as EJB JAR files, are packaged into an EAR file, the
archive file that holds the application. Security annotations will be
used in the Java programming class files to specify authorized users and
basic, or user name/password, authentication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enterprise beans often provide the business logic of a web application.
In these cases, packaging the enterprise bean within the web
application&#8217;s WAR module simplifies deployment and application
organization. Enterprise beans may be packaged within a WAR module as
Java class files or within a JAR file that is bundled within the WAR
module. When a servlet or JavaServer Faces page handles the web front
end and the application is packaged into a WAR module as a Java class
file, security for the application can be handled in the application&#8217;s
<code>web.xml</code> file. The EJB in the WAR file can have its own deployment
descriptor, <code>ejb-jar.xml</code>, if required. Securing web applications using
<code>web.xml</code> is discussed in <a href="security-webtier.html#BNCAS">Chapter 51,
"Getting Started Securing Web Applications"</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sections describe declarative and programmatic security
mechanisms that can be used to protect enterprise bean resources. The
protected resources include enterprise bean methods that are called from
application clients, web components, or other enterprise beans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more information on this topic, read the Enterprise JavaBeans 3.2
specification. This document can be downloaded from
<code>http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=345</code>. Chapter 12 of this specification,
"Security Management," discusses security management for enterprise
beans.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="securing-an-enterprise-bean-using-declarative-security">Securing an Enterprise Bean Using Declarative Security</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Declarative security enables the application developer to specify which
users are authorized to access which methods of the enterprise beans and
to authenticate these users with basic, or user name/password,
authentication. Frequently, the person who is developing an enterprise
application is not the same person who is responsible for deploying the
application. An application developer who uses declarative security to
define method permissions and authentication mechanisms is passing along
to the deployer a security view of the enterprise beans contained in the
EJB JAR. When a security view is passed on to the deployer, he or she
uses this information to define method permissions for security roles.
If you don&#8217;t define a security view, the deployer will have to determine
what each business method does to determine which users are authorized
to call each method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A security view consists of a set of security roles, a semantic grouping
of permissions that a given type of users of an application must have to
successfully access the application. Security roles are meant to be
logical roles, representing a type of user. You can define method
permissions for each security role. A method permission is a permission
to invoke a specified group of methods of an enterprise bean&#8217;s business
interface, home interface, component interface, and/or web service
endpoints. After method permissions are defined, user name/password
authentication will be used to verify the identity of the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to keep in mind that security roles are used to define
the logical security view of an application. They should not be confused
with the user groups, users, principals, and other concepts that exist
in GlassFish Server. An additional step is required to map the roles
defined in the application to users, groups, and principals that are the
components of the user database in the <code>file</code> realm of GlassFish Server.
These steps are outlined in <a href="security-intro005.html#BNBXV">Mapping
Roles to Users and Groups</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sections show how an application developer uses
declarative security to either secure an application or to create a
security view to pass along to the deployer.</p>

<h4 id="specifying-authorized-users-by-declaring-security-roles">Specifying Authorized Users by Declaring Security Roles</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section discusses how to use annotations to specify the method
permissions for the methods of a bean class. For more information on
these annotations, refer to the Common Annotations for the Java Platform
specification at <code>http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=250</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Method permissions can be specified on the class, the business methods
of the class, or both. Method permissions can be specified on a method
of the bean class to override the method permissions value specified on
the entire bean class. The following annotations are used to specify
method permissions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>@DeclareRoles</code>: Specifies all the roles that the application will
use, including roles not specifically named in a <code>@RolesAllowed</code>
annotation. The set of security roles the application uses is the total
of the security roles defined in the <code>@DeclareRoles</code> and <code>@RolesAllowed</code>
annotations.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>@DeclareRoles</code> annotation is specified on a bean class, where it
serves to declare roles that can be tested (for example, by calling
<code>isCallerInRole</code>) from within the methods of the annotated class. When
declaring the name of a role used as a parameter to the
<code>isCallerInRole(String roleName)</code> method, the declared name must be the
same as the parameter value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following example code demonstrates the use of the <code>@DeclareRoles</code>
annotation:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The syntax for declaring more than one role is as shown in the following
example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">@DeclareRoles({"Administrator", "Manager", "Employee"})</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@RolesAllowed("_list-of-roles_")</code>: Specifies the security roles
permitted to access methods in an application. This annotation can be
specified on a class or on one or more methods. When specified at the
class level, the annotation applies to all methods in the class. When
specified on a method, the annotation applies to that method only and
overrides any values specified at the class level.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To specify that no roles are authorized to access methods in an
application, use the <code>@DenyAll</code> annotation. To specify that a user in
any role is authorized to access the application, use the <code>@PermitAll</code>
annotation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When used in conjunction with the <code>@DeclareRoles</code> annotation, the
combined set of security roles is used by the application.</p>

a database to ensure that he or she is authorized to access this
application.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no way for the target container to authenticate the propagated
security identity. However, because the security identity is used in
authorization checks (for example, method permissions or with the
<code>isCallerInRole</code> method), it is vitally important that the security
identity be authentic. Because no authentication data is available to
authenticate the propagated identity, the target must trust that the
calling container has propagated an authenticated security identity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, GlassFish Server is configured to trust identities that are
propagated from different containers. Therefore, you do not need to take
any special steps to set up a trust relationship.</p>

<p>The deployer is responsible for ensuring that an assembled application
is secure after it has been deployed in the target operational
environment. If a security view has been provided to the deployer
through the use of security annotations and/or a deployment descriptor,
the security view is mapped to the mechanisms and policies used by the
security domain in the target operational environment, which in this
case is GlassFish Server. If no security view is provided, the deployer
must set up the appropriate security policy for the enterprise bean
application.</p>
