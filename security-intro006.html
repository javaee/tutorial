<h2 id="establishing-a-secure-connection-using-ssl">Establishing a Secure Connection Using SSL</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology is security that is implemented at
the transport layer (see
<a href="security-intro002.html#BNBXC">Transport-Layer Security</a> for more
information about transport-layer security). SSL allows web browsers and
web servers to communicate over a secure connection. In this secure
connection, the data is encrypted before being sent and then is
decrypted upon receipt and before processing. Both the browser and the
server encrypt all traffic before sending any data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SSL addresses the following important security considerations.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Authentication: During your initial attempt to communicate with a web
server over a secure connection, that server will present your web
browser with a set of credentials in the form of a server certificate
(also called a public key certificate). The purpose of the certificate
is to verify that the site is who and what it claims to be. In some
cases, the server may request a certificate proving that the client is
who and what it claims to be; this mechanism is known as client
authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confidentiality: When data is being passed between the client and the
server on a network, third parties can view and intercept this data. SSL
responses are encrypted so that the data cannot be deciphered by the
third party and the data remains confidential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrity: When data is being passed between the client and the server
on a network, third parties can view and intercept this data. SSL helps
guarantee that the data will not be modified in transit by that third
party.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SSL protocol is designed to be as efficient as securely possible.
However, encryption and decryption are computationally expensive
processes from a performance standpoint. It is not strictly necessary to
run an entire web application over SSL, and it is customary for a
developer to decide which pages require a secure connection and which do
not. Pages that might require a secure connection include those for
login, personal information, shopping cart checkouts, or credit card
information transmittal. Any page within an application can be requested
over a secure socket by simply prefixing the address with <code>https:</code>
instead of <code>http:</code>. Any pages that absolutely require a secure
connection should check the protocol type associated with the page
request and take the appropriate action if <code>https:</code> is not specified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using name-based virtual hosts on a secured connection can be
problematic. This is a design limitation of the SSL protocol itself. The
SSL handshake, whereby the client browser accepts the server
certificate, must occur before the HTTP request is accessed. As a
result, the request information containing the virtual host name cannot
be determined before authentication, and it is therefore not possible to
assign multiple certificates to a single IP address. If all virtual
hosts on a single IP address need to authenticate against the same
certificate, the addition of multiple virtual hosts should not interfere
with normal SSL operations on the server. Be aware, however, that most
client browsers will compare the server&#8217;s domain name against the domain
name listed in the certificate, if any; this is applicable primarily to
official certificates signed by a certificate authority (CA). If the
domain names do not match, these browsers will display a warning to the
client. In general, only address-based virtual hosts are commonly used
with SSL in a production environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="verifying-and-configuring-ssl-support">Verifying and Configuring SSL Support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a general rule, you must address the following issues to enable SSL
for a server.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>There must be a <code>Connector</code> element for an SSL connector in the server
deployment descriptor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There must be valid keystore and certificate files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The location of the keystore file and its password must be specified
in the server deployment descriptor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An SSL HTTPS connector is already enabled in GlassFish Server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For testing purposes and to verify that SSL support has been correctly
installed, load the default introduction page with a URL that connects
to the port defined in the server deployment descriptor:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">https://localhost:8181/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>https</code> in this URL indicates that the browser should be using the
SSL protocol. The <code>localhost</code> in this example assumes that you are
running the example on your local machine as part of the development
process. The <code>8181</code> in this example is the secure port that was
specified where the SSL connector was created. If you are using a
different server or port, modify this value accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first time that you load this application, the New Site Certificate
or Security Alert dialog box appears. Click Next to move through the
series of dialog boxes, and click Finish when you reach the last dialog
box. The certificates will appear only the first time. When you accept
the certificates, subsequent hits to this site assume that you still
trust the content.</p>
