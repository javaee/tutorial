<h2 id="introduction-to-batch-processing">Introduction to Batch Processing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some enterprise applications contain tasks that can be executed without
user interaction. These tasks are executed periodically or when resource
usage is low, and they often process large amounts of information such
as log files, database records, or images. Examples include billing,
report generation, data format conversion, and image processing. These
tasks are called batch jobs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch processing refers to running batch jobs on a computer system. Java
EE includes a batch processing framework that provides the batch
execution infrastructure common to all batch applications, enabling
developers to concentrate on the business logic of their batch
applications. The batch framework consists of a job specification
language based on XML, a set of batch annotations and interfaces for
application classes that implement the business logic, a batch container
that manages the execution of batch jobs, and supporting classes and
interfaces to interact with the batch container.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A batch job can be completed without user intervention. For example,
consider a telephone billing application that reads phone call records
from the enterprise information systems and generates a monthly bill for
each account. Since this application does not require any user
interaction, it can run as a batch job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The phone billing application consists of two phases: The first phase
associates each call from the registry with a monthly bill, and the
second phase calculates the tax and total amount due for each bill. Each
of these phases is a step of the batch job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch applications specify a set of steps and their execution order.
Different batch frameworks may specify additional elements, like
decision elements or groups of steps that run in parallel. The following
sections describe steps in more detail and provide information about
other common characteristics of batch frameworks.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="steps-in-batch-jobs">Steps in Batch Jobs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A step is an independent and sequential phase of a batch job. Batch jobs
contain chunk-oriented steps and task-oriented steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chunk-oriented steps (chunk steps) process data by reading items from
a data source, applying some business logic to each item, and storing
the results. Chunk steps read and process one item at a time and group
the results into a chunk. The results are stored when the chunk reaches
a configurable size. Chunk-oriented processing makes storing results
more efficient and facilitates transaction demarcation.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Chunk steps have three parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The input retrieval part reads one item at a time from a data source,
such as entries on a database, files in a directory, or entries in a log
file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The business processing part manipulates one item at a time using the
business logic defined by the application. Examples include filtering,
formatting, and accessing data from the item for computing a result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The output writing part stores a chunk of processed items at a time.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Chunk steps are often long-running because they process large amounts of
data. Batch frameworks enable chunk steps to bookmark their progress
using checkpoints. A chunk step that is interrupted can be restarted
from the last checkpoint. The input retrieval and output writing parts
of a chunk step save their current position after the processing of each
chunk, and can recover it when the step is restarted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#BABFJBAH">Figure 56-1</a> shows the three parts of two steps in a
batch job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title"><strong>Figure 56-1 Chunk Steps in a Batch Job</strong></div>
<p><span class="image"><img src="img/javaeett_dt_058.png" alt="This figure shows a batch job that contains two chunk steps: step A and step B. Step A has the three parts of a chunk-oriented step: input retrieval A, business processing A, and output writing A. Step B also has the three parts of a chunk-oriented step: input retrieval B, business processing B, and output writing B."></span></p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the phone billing application consists of two chunk steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the first step, the input retrieval part reads call records from
the registry; the business processing part associates each call with a
bill and creates a bill if one does not exist for an account; and the
output writing part stores each bill in a database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second step, the input retrieval part reads bills from the
database; the business processing part calculates the tax and total
amount due for each bill; and the output writing part updates the
database records and generates printable versions of each bill.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This application could also contain a task step that cleaned up the
files from the bills generated for the previous month.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="parallel-processing">Parallel Processing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch jobs often process large amounts of data or perform
computationally expensive operations. Batch applications can benefit
from parallel processing in two scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Steps that do not depend on each other can run on different threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chunk-oriented steps where the processing of each item does not depend
on the results of processing previous items can run on more than one
thread.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch frameworks provide mechanisms for developers to define groups of
independent steps and to split chunk-oriented steps in parts that can
run in parallel.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="status-and-decision-elements">Status and Decision Elements</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch frameworks keep track of a status for every step in a job. The
status indicates if a step is running or if it has completed. If the
step has completed, the status indicates one of the following.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The execution of the step was successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The step was interrupted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An error occurred in the execution of the step.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to steps, batch jobs can also contain decision elements.
Decision elements use the exit status of the previous step to determine
the next step or to terminate the batch job. Decision elements set the
status of the batch job when terminating it. Like a step, a batch job
can terminate successfully, be interrupted, or fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#BCGDCDCA">Figure 56-2</a> shows an example of a job that contains
chunk steps, task steps and a decision element.</p>
</div>
<div id="BCGDCDCA" class="paragraph">

<p><span class="image"><img src="img/javaeett_dt_059.png" alt="This figure shows a batch job that contains two chunk steps, a task step and a decision element. The job starts with chunk step A, continues with chunk step B, and then decision element D evaluates condition 1. The condition is based on the status of step B. If condition 1 is true, the job terminates; otherwise the job continues with step C and then the job ends."></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="batch-framework-functionality">Batch Framework Functionality</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch applications have the following common requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define jobs, steps, decision elements, and the relationships between
them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute some groups of steps or parts of a step in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain state information for jobs and steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch jobs and resume interrupted jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch frameworks provide the batch execution infrastructure that
addresses the common requirements of all batch applications, enabling
developers to concentrate on the business logic of their applications.
Batch frameworks consist of a format to specify jobs and steps, an
application programming interface (API), and a service available at
runtime that manages the execution of batch jobs.</p>
