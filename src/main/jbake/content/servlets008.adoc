Accessing the Web Context
-------------------------

The context in which web components execute is an object that implements
the `ServletContext` interface. You retrieve the web context by using
the `getServletContext` method. The web context provides methods for
accessing

* Initialization parameters
* Resources associated with the web context
* Object-valued attributes
* Logging capabilities

The counter's access methods are synchronized to prevent incompatible
operations by servlets that are running concurrently. A filter retrieves
the counter object by using the context's `getAttribute` method. The
incremented value of the counter is recorded in the log.
