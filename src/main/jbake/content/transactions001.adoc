Overview of Transactions
------------------------

A typical enterprise application accesses and stores information in one
or more databases. Because this information is critical for business
operations, it must be accurate, current, and reliable. Data integrity
would be lost if multiple programs were allowed to update the same
information simultaneously or if a system that failed while processing a
business transaction were to leave the affected data only partially
updated. By preventing both of these scenarios, software transactions
ensure data integrity. Transactions control the concurrent access of
data by multiple programs. In the event of a system failure,
transactions make sure that after recovery, the data will be in a
consistent state.
