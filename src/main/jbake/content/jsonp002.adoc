JSON Processing in the Java EE Platform
---------------------------------------

Java EE includes support for JSR 353, which provides an API to parse,
transform, and query JSON data using the object model or the streaming
model described in link:jsonp001.html#BABJJACI[Generating and Parsing
JSON Data]. The Java API for JSON Processing contains the following
packages.

* The `javax.json` package contains a reader interface, a writer
interface, and a model builder interface for the object model. This
package also contains other utility classes and Java types for JSON
elements. link:#CHDJJCBE[Table 19-1] lists the main classes and
interfaces in this package.
* The `javax.json.stream` package contains a parser interface and a
generator interface for the streaming model. link:#CHDIHCEG[Table 19-2]
lists the main classes and interfaces in this package.

|=======================================================================
|Class or Interface |Description
|`Json` |Contains static methods to create instances of JSON parsers,
builders, and generators. This class also contains methods to create
parser, builder, and generator factory objects.

|`JsonReader` |Reads JSON data from a stream and creates an object model
in memory.

a|
`JsonObjectBuilder`

`JsonArrayBuilder`

 |Create an object model or an array model in memory by adding elements
from application code.

|`JsonWriter` |Writes an object model from memory to a stream.

|`JsonValue` |Represents an element (such as an object, an array, or a
value) in JSON data.

|`JsonStructure` |Represents an object or an array in JSON data. This
interface is a subtype of `JsonValue`.

a|
`JsonObject`

`JsonArray`

 |Represent an object or an array in JSON data. These two interfaces are
subtypes of `JsonStructure`.

a|
`JsonString`

`JsonNumber`

 |Represent data types for elements in JSON data. These two interfaces
are subtypes of `JsonValue`.

|`JsonException` |Indicates that a problem occurred during JSON
processing.

|=======================================================================
|Class or Interface |Description
|`JsonParser` |Represents an event-based parser that can read JSON data
from a stream or from an object model.

|`JsonGenerator` |Writes JSON data to a stream one element at a time.
