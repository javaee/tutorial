Configuring the CDI Container
-----------------------------

The configuration of the `SeContainerInitializer` instance allows the explicit addition of elements into an internal *synthetic bean archive*. The synthetic bean archive represents the set of beans that have been loaded while initializing the container. The contents of the synthetic bean archive depend on whether discovery is enabled: 

* If discovery is enabled, the synthetic bean archive is created using standard bean discovery rules and contains a superset of all JAR files on the classpath. Archives that do not include a `beans.xml` file are excluded.
* If discovery is disabled, and beans are added programmatically, the synthetic bean archive contains only the beans that have been programmatically added.
