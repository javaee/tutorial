Injecting Beans
---------------

In order to use the beans you create, you inject them into yet another
bean that can then be used by an application, such as a JavaServer Faces
application. For example, you might create a bean called `Printer` into
which you would inject one of the `Greeting` beans:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;

public class Printer {

    @Inject Greeting greeting;
    ...
}
----

This code injects the `@Default` `Greeting` implementation into the
bean. The following code injects the `@Informal` implementation:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;

public class Printer {

    @Inject @Informal Greeting greeting;
    ...
}
----

More is needed for the complete picture of this bean. Its use of scope
needs to be understood. In addition, for a JavaServer Faces application,
the bean needs to be accessible through the EL.
