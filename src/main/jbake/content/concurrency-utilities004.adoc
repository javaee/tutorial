Concurrency and Security
------------------------

Concurrency Utilities for Java EE defers most security decisions to the
application server implementation. If, however, the container supports a
security context, that context can be propagated to the thread of
execution. The `ContextService` can support several runtime behaviors,
and the `security` attribute, if enabled, will propagate the container
security principal.
