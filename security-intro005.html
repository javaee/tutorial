<div class="paragraph">
<p>A realm is a security policy domain defined for a web or application
server. A realm contains a collection of users, who may or may not be
assigned to a group. Managing users in GlassFish Server is discussed in
<a href="#BNBXR">Managing Users and Groups in GlassFish Server</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An application will often prompt for a user name and password before
allowing access to a protected resource. After the user name and
password have been entered, that information is passed to the server,
which either authenticates the user and sends the protected resource or
does not authenticate the user, in which case access to the protected
resource is denied. This type of user authentication is discussed in
<a href="security-webtier002.html#BNCBN">Specifying an Authentication
Mechanism in the Deployment Descriptor</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some applications, authorized users are assigned to roles. In this
situation, the role assigned to the user in the application must be
mapped to a principal or group defined on the application server.
<a href="#BNBXL">Figure 50-6</a> shows this. More information on mapping roles
to users and groups can be found in <a href="#BNBXU">Setting Up Security

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_is_a_realm">What Is a Realm?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The protected resources on a server can be partitioned into a set of
protection spaces, each with its own authentication scheme and/or
authorization database containing a collection of users and groups. A
realm is a complete database of users and groups identified as valid
users of one or more applications and controlled by the same
authentication policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Java EE server authentication service can govern users in multiple
realms. The <code>file</code>, <code>admin-realm</code>, and <code>certificate</code> realms come
preconfigured for GlassFish Server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the <code>file</code> realm, the server stores user credentials locally in a
file named <code>keyfile</code>. You can use the Administration Console to manage
users in the <code>file</code> realm. When using the <code>file</code> realm, the server
authentication service verifies user identity by checking the <code>file</code>
realm. This realm is used for the authentication of all clients except
for web browser clients that use HTTPS and certificates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the <code>certificate</code> realm, the server stores user credentials in a
certificate database. When using the <code>certificate</code> realm, the server
uses certificates with HTTPS to authenticate web clients. To verify the
identity of a user in the <code>certificate</code> realm, the authentication
service verifies an X.509 certificate. For step-by-step instructions for
creating this type of certificate, see
<a href="security-advanced001.html#BNBYB">Working with Digital Certificates</a>.
The common name field of the X.509 certificate is used as the principal
name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>admin-realm</code> is also a <code>file</code> realm and stores administrator user
credentials locally in a file named <code>admin-keyfile</code>. You can use the
Administration Console to manage users in this realm in the same way you
manage users in the <code>file</code> realm. For more information, see
<a href="#BNBXR">Managing Users and Groups in GlassFish Server</a>.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_is_a_user">What Is a User?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A user is an individual or application program identity that has been
defined in GlassFish Server. In a web application, a user can have
associated with that identity a set of roles that entitle the user to
access all resources protected by those roles. Users can be associated
with a group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Java EE user is similar to an operating system user. Typically, both
types of users represent people. However, these two types of users are
not the same. The Java EE server authentication service has no knowledge
of the user name and password you provide when you log in to the
operating system. The Java EE server authentication service is not
connected to the security mechanism of the operating system. The two
security services manage users that belong to different realms.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_is_a_group">What Is a Group?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A group is a set of authenticated users, classified by common traits,
defined in GlassFish Server. A Java EE user of the <code>file</code> realm can
belong to a group in GlassFish Server. (A user in the <code>certificate</code>
realm cannot.) A group in GlassFish Server is a category of users
classified by common traits, such as job title or customer profile. For
example, most customers of an e-commerce application might belong to the
<code>CUSTOMER</code> group, but the big spenders would belong to the <code>PREFERRED</code>
group. Categorizing users into groups makes it easier to control the
access of large numbers of users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A group in GlassFish Server has a different scope from a role. A group
is designated for the entire GlassFish Server, whereas a role is
associated only with a specific application in GlassFish Server.</p>

<h4 id="_what_is_a_role">What Is a Role?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A role is an abstract name for the permission to access a particular set
of resources in an application. A role can be compared to a key that can
open a lock. Many people might have a copy of the key. The lock doesn&#8217;t
care who you are, only that you have the right key.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A principal is an entity that can be authenticated by an
authentication protocol in a security service that is deployed in an
enterprise. A principal is identified by using a principal name and
authenticated by using authentication data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A security policy domain, also known as a security domain or realm, is
a scope over which a common security policy is defined and enforced by
the security administrator of the security service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security attributes are a set of attributes associated with every
principal. The security attributes have many uses: for example, access
to protected resources and auditing of users. Security attributes can be
associated with a principal by an authentication protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A credential is an object that contains or references security
attributes used to authenticate a principal for Java EE services. A
principal acquires a credential upon authentication or from another
principal that allows its credential to be used.</p>

<h3 id="_setting_up_security_roles">Setting Up Security Roles</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you design an enterprise bean or web component, you should always
think about the kinds of users who will access the component. For
example, a web application for a human resources department might have a
different request URL for someone who has been assigned the role of
<code>DEPT_ADMIN</code> than for someone who has been assigned the role of
<code>DIRECTOR</code>. The <code>DEPT_ADMIN</code> role may let you view employee data, but
the <code>DIRECTOR</code> role enables you to modify employee data, including
salary data. Each of these security roles is an abstract logical
grouping of users that is defined by the person who assembles the
application. When an application is deployed, the deployer will map the
roles to security identities in the operational environment, as shown in
<a href="#BNBXL">Figure 50-6</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Java EE components, you define security roles using the
<code>@DeclareRoles</code> and <code>@RolesAllowed</code> metadata annotations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following is an example of an application in which the role of
<code>DEPT-ADMIN</code> is authorized for methods that review employee payroll
data, and the role of <code>DIRECTOR</code> is authorized for methods that change
employee payroll data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The enterprise bean would be annotated as shown in the following code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">import javax.annotation.security.DeclareRoles;
import javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;
...
@DeclareRoles({"DEPT-ADMIN", "DIRECTOR"})
@Stateless public class PayrollBean implements Payroll {
    @Resource SessionContext ctx;


    @RolesAllowed("DEPT-ADMIN")
    public void reviewEmployeeInfo(EmplInfo info) {

        oldInfo = ... read from database;

        // ...
    }

    @RolesAllowed("DIRECTOR")
    public void updateEmployeeInfo(EmplInfo info) {

        newInfo = ... update database;

        // ...
    }
    ...
 }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a servlet, you can use the <code>@HttpConstraint</code> annotation within the
<code>@ServletSecurity</code> annotation to specify the roles that are allowed to
access the servlet. For example, a servlet might be annotated as
follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">@WebServlet(name = "PayrollServlet", urlPatterns = {"/payroll"})
@ServletSecurity(
@HttpConstraint(transportGuarantee = TransportGuarantee.CONFIDENTIAL,
    rolesAllowed = {"DEPT-ADMIN", "DIRECTOR"}))
public class GreetingServlet extends HttpServlet {</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These annotations are discussed in more detail in

Authentication Using Annotations</a> and
<a href="security-javaee002.html#GJGDI">Securing an Enterprise Bean Using

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After users have provided their login information and the application
has declared what roles are authorized to access protected parts of an
application, the next step is to map the security role to the name of a
user, or principal.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="BNBXV"></a><a id="mapping-roles-to-users-and-groups"></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_mapping_roles_to_users_and_groups">Mapping Roles to Users and Groups</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you are developing a Java EE application, you don&#8217;t need to know
what categories of users have been defined for the realm in which the
application will be run. In the Java EE platform, the security
architecture provides a mechanism for mapping the roles defined in the
application to the users or groups defined in the runtime realm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The role names used in the application are often the same as the group
names defined in GlassFish Server. The Java EE Security API requires that
group principal names are mapped
to roles of the same name by default. Accordingly, the <strong>Default Principal To Role Mapping</strong> setting
is enabled by default on the Security page of
the GlassFish Server Administration Console. All the tutorial security
examples use default principal-to-role mapping. With that setting
enabled, if the group name defined on GlassFish Server matches the role
name defined in the application, there is no need to use the runtime
deployment descriptor to provide a mapping. The application server will
implicitly make this mapping, as long as the names of the groups and
roles match.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the role names used in an application are not the same as the group
names defined on the server, use the runtime deployment descriptor to
specify the mapping. The following example demonstrates how to do this
mapping in the <code>glassfish-web.xml</code> file, which is the file used for web
applications:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">&lt;glassfish-web-app&gt;
    ...
    &lt;security-role-mapping&gt;
        &lt;role-name&gt;Mascot&lt;/role-name&gt;
        &lt;principal-name&gt;Duke&lt;/principal-name&gt;
    &lt;/security-role-mapping&gt;

    &lt;security-role-mapping&gt;
        &lt;role-name&gt;Admin&lt;/role-name&gt;
        &lt;group-name&gt;Director&lt;/group-name&gt;
    &lt;/security-role-mapping&gt;
    ...
&lt;/glassfish-web-app&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A role can be mapped to specific principals, specific groups, or both.
The principal or group names must be valid principals or groups in the
current default realm or in the realm specified in the <code>login-config</code>
element. In this example, the role of <code>Mascot</code> used in the application
is mapped to a principal, named <code>Duke</code>, that exists on the application
server. Mapping a role to a specific principal is useful when the person
occupying that role may change. For this application, you would need to
modify only the runtime deployment descriptor rather than search and
replace throughout the application for references to this principal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also in this example, the role of <code>Admin</code> is mapped to a group of users
assigned the group name of <code>Director</code>. This is useful because the group
of people authorized to access director-level administrative data has to
be maintained only in GlassFish Server. The application developer does
not need to know who these people are, but only needs to define the
group of people who will be given access to the information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>role-name</code> must match the <code>role-name</code> in the <code>security-role</code>
element of the corresponding deployment descriptor or the role name
defined in a <code>@DeclareRoles</code> annotation.</p>
